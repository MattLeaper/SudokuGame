This is a desktop Sudoku game built in Java using Swing. It features a graphical 9Ã—9 grid, randomly generated puzzles with selectable difficulty (Easy, Medium, Hard), a real-time timer, and user-friendly controls. The game includes error highlighting as you type, an undo button to revert the last move, and a hint system that reveals one correct cell. It's structured for readability and can be easily extended. To run it, open the project in a Java IDE (like Eclipse or IntelliJ), ensure all .java files are in the same package, and run the SudokuGUI.java file which contains the main method.
